// Public cases

The input file for each public case is in its corresponding directory /home/public/case*

There are two additional cases, casea and caseb, these cases will NOT be counted for final score.

// Checker

The checker is in /home/public/checker, you should first copy it to your own directory

	cp /home/public/checker /home/eda2204XX/ -rf

copy both input.txt and output.txt to the checker directory

	cp /XX/input.txt /home/eda2204XX/checker/input.txt
	cp /XX/output.txt /home/eda2204XX/checker/output.txt

then enter the directory and run the checker

	cd /home/eda2204XX/checker
	dist/checker

Current version is 1.1

// Submission

1. Please prepare an executable of your code in your own directory, the executable should automatically create output.txt based on the input.txt in a FIXED RELATIVE path, WITHOUT any manual input.
2. Please prepare a README in the same directory, containing following:
	a) UI of your executable
	b) Is there any dependent file/configuration if your executable was copied and tested elsewhere
